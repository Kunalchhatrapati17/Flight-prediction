#Flight-Prediction Project

#Descirption of the project:-
#1. For this project we took a dataset from Kaggle here is the link for the same where you can download the dataset:-
#2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/flight-delay-dataset-20182022?select=Combined_Flights_2018.csv

#Overview of the project:-
#In this project, our aim was to develop a Web-Application that predicts Flight Data and identify factors affecting flight delays, based on Cancellations and delays for each airline. Things we did in this project were:-
#1. Categorized the delays of airlines into small, moderate, and Large Delays.
#2. Depicted piechart which showed each delay.
#3. It showed Flight Delays based on flight codes and their Descriptions for each airline.
#4. Also, it showed the number of flights canceled for each airline.
#5. We Deployed the application on an EC-2 instance cluster with a technology stack that included React js, AWS-EMR, S3 Bucket, EC-2 instances, and PySpark and extracted data using Apache Spark, and Hadoop.

#Steps to Run the project:-
#1. Before running this project combine all the node_modules into one file and name it node_modules.
#2. First, make sure that you have installed Node.js and npm(Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download them from the official Node.js website:- https://nodejs.org/en
#3. Setup the path for desired React js file on the terminal and navigate to it.
#4. Start Development Server by running the React app, using the following command on to the terminal:- npm start
#5. To Access the React Application, you access the application by opening a web browser and navigating it to http://localhost:3000/ and by clicking on this link it will be redirected to the respected URL.
